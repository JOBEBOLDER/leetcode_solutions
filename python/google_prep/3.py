Hi folks,

I had a Google onsite interview last week and was asked the following problem. 
I wanted to discuss if anyone recently got asked this problem and wanted to discuss 
regarding its follow up

Problem statement:

You’re given:

A total data size N

A maximum allowed packet capacity C

You must split the data into the minimum number of packets, where each packet size ≤ C.

If multiple solutions exist with the same minimum number of packets, choose the one where:

The maximum packet size among all packets is minimized.
