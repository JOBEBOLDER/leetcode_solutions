I had previously cleared the screen round of google, so I scheduled all the coding rounds on the same day with 1 hour gap. Here are the different questions that were asked in each of the rounds:

Round 1
Question: You are given a graph of cities where each vertice denotes a city, and the edges represent the connectivity between two cities. 
You can assume that the cost to travel from one city to another connected by a single edge is 1 unit. 
There are two friends Alice and Bob who live in two different cities and want to reach to destination city to attend a concert. 
Both Alice and Bob plan to take cabs from their cities to reach the destination. They may decide to share a cab in order to minimize the total cost to travel the destination city. Your task is to find the minimum cost for both Alice and Bob combined to reach destination.
Example:

A - B
|   |
D - C
|   |
E - F
Alice=A, Bob=E, destination=C
Output: 3 (Alice go from A to D, cost=1. Bob go from E to D, cost=1. 
Then both Alice and Bob share a cab from D to C, cost=1. Hence, total cost = 1+1+1 = 3)
My Take: I was not able to solve this problem as I was too fixated on trying to come up with an 
optimal approach so just kept ignoring the interviewer asking me to implement the brute-force solution. 
Would appreciate a lot if someone could provide an optimal solution for this problem, and how one shoud approach it!
