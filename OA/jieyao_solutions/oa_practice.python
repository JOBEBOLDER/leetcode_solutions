🧩 Question 1 — Endpoint Node in a Network

Function signature:

def compute(start_node_id: int, from_ids: List[int], to_ids: List[int]) -> int:


⸻

Description

Implement the function compute(start_node_id, from_ids, to_ids) which should return the last node id of the network found when starting from the node with id start_node_id and following the links of the network.

The goal of this exercise is to find the endpoint node of a simple network, or find the loop if there is one.

In this simple network, each node is linked to at most one outgoing node in a one-way forward direction.

⸻

Parameters
	•	start_node_id (int): Id of the starting node.
	•	from_ids (List[int]): Ids of the linked nodes (link starts).
	•	to_ids (List[int]): Ids of the linked nodes (link ends).

from_ids and to_ids are two arrays of the same length which describe the one-way links of the network (from_ids[i] is linked to to_ids[i]).

⸻

Return value
	•	output (int): Endpoint node id, or node id before closing the loop.

In case you run into a loop when traversing the network, the function should return the id of the last node traversed before closing the loop.

⸻

Constraints
	•	1 < node id < 5000
	•	The node ids are not necessarily ordered.
	•	A node will never be directly linked to itself.

⸻

Example

start_node_id = 6
from_ids = [4, 9, 6, 1]
to_ids   = [9, 5, 1, 4]

Return value: 5

⸻

Explanation

In this network, starting from node 6, you traverse:

6 → 1 → 4 → 9 → 5

Node 5 has no outgoing edge, so it is the endpoint node.
